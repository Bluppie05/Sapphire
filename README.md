# Sapphire
A simple but yet powerfull programming language designed to teach newbies how to code

Sapphire is a simple programming language with teaches newcomers how to code and it helps you to transition later into more powerfull pogramming languages

Sapphire is based on python3 and designed in a way to run every single python3 command aswell as a big variety of sapphire commands which are much much easier to remember and can help you to learn the basics of programming

# Sapphire commands example:

	lib bashline
	
	say("Welcome")
	
	userinput = prompt("How old are you: ")

	if userinput equals "13":
		say("Hey, me too!")
	
	else-if userinput equals "100":
		say("WOW, that is old")
	
	else:
		say("Thank you for your input")
	

bashline("echo 'this is a command executed inside the bash language'")

# ------------------

say: it prints the given string/integer/variable/list

lib: it imports sapphire libraries

prompt: it prompts the user for input

if: triggers if statement is true

equals: the word version of ==

else-if: an easier command to remember than elif

else: triggers if the if statement is false

bashline: can execute commands from the bash and bat language to make sapphire more powerfull

etc...
